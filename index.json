Many specific systolic array structures of matrix decomposition algorithms have been proposed previously to maintain high performance as the problem size scales up. In this paper, we broadly explore different mappings of most frequently used Cholesky, LU and QR decomposition algorithms to systolic arrays. We follow the canonical mapping method to define the systolic array design space. By selecting different linear projection vectors on the dependency graph of each algorithm, multiple one-dimensional and two-dimensional systolic arrays are generated. To obtain better performance, we also introduce streaming dataflow on the top module which enables heterogeneous PEs to work in data-driven manners. All designs are implemented using the Xilinx Vivado High-Level Synthesis tools. We show in our experimental results the differences in performance and resource consumption of each mapping. We also demonstrate up to 50.13x and 4.58x better throughput of our implementations compared with the Xilinx HLS linear algebra library and the LAPACK library on CPUs.","tags":[],"title":"Dataflow Systolic Array Implementations of Matrix Decomposition using High Level Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hong Chen","Zhecheng Yang","Jilin Zhang","Jie Liu","Hao Tang","Yixin Zhou","Binjie Zhu","Zhihua Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To improve the success rate of THR operation, the measurement of acetabular prosthesis angles should be precise during the surgery. We design an inertial measurement unit based real-time measurement system, which measures the initial attitude of the pelvis coordinate, and traces the real-time attitude of the pelvis coordinate and prosthesis axis. By collecting real-time data of diff- erent pelvic and prosthesis attitudes in quaternion representation through accelerometers and gyroscopes, the relative position between pelvis and prosthesis is calculated in real time. An optimized algorithm is proposed to obtain prosthesis implant angles accurately from the data. The experimental results show that the measured implant angles agree with that calculated by radiographic value, the root mean square errors (RMSE) are less than 3.52 degrees, which is within the safe range of THR requirement. Furthermore, no matter how the implant angles change, the measured values agree with reference values, the RMSE is less than 3.27 degrees. The experimental results show that our system can trace the real-time dislocation of the prosthesis during the THR surgeries.","tags":[],"title":"IMU-based Real-Time Acetabular Prosthesis Implant Angles Measurement in Total Hip Replacement Surgeries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nitish Srivastava","Hanchen Jin","Jie Liu","David Albonesi","Zhiru Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, the failure rate of THR surgeries is up to 10% following primary surgery and 28% after revision arthroplasty, which has direct correlation to the implantation angles between prosthesis and pelvis. To improve the implanting accuracy of the prosthesis, we propose a measurement system and estimation algorithms. The system includes three parts: an initial attitude measurement instrument, which is used to determine the initial attitude of the anterior pelvic plane (APP), a real-time attitude measurement instrument, which aims to acquire the real-time attitude of the APP, and an acetabular cup angle measurement instrument, which obtains the relative angles between prosthesis and pelvis. Each of them is based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and magnetometer. A quaternion-based extended Kalman filter is adopted to fuse the data from IMU and magnetometer to estimate the orientation, and the algorithm calculating the attitude of pelvis and relative angles between pelvis and prosthesis is designed in this paper. The reliability of this system, from the measurement point of view, has been verified by experiments. The experimental results show that the root-meansquare errors of APP attitude and acetabular cup implanting orientation are less than 1.6¬∞ and 3¬∞ with standard uncertainty of less than 0.22¬∞ and 0.17¬∞, respectively. The accuracy of our system meets the requirement of the THR surgeries.","tags":[],"title":"MatRaptor: A Sparse-Sparse Matrix Multiplication Accelerator Based on Row-Wise Product","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hong Chen","Zhe Cao","Shaojie Su","Jie Liu","Zhihua Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
